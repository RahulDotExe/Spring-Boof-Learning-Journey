- **Get All Jobs**: Retrieve all available jobs
- **Get Job by ID**: Fetch specific job details
- **Update Job**: Modify existing job information
- **Delete Job**: Remove job listings
- **In-Memory Storage**: Uses ArrayList for data persistence (no database required)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Java 17** (or your version)
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Spring Web**
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Postman** for API testing

## üß™ Testing the API

### Using Postman
1. Import the Postman collection from `/postman/Job-API-Collection.json`
2. Run the requests in the following order:
    - POST to create jobs
    - GET to retrieve jobs
    - PUT to update jobs
    - DELETE to remove jobs

### Using cURL
```bash
# Create a job
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Data Scientist",
    "description": "Analyze large datasets",
    "minSalary": "80000",
    "maxSalary": "110000",
    "location": "Boston"
  }'

# Get all jobs
curl http://localhost:8080/jobs

# Get job by ID
curl http://localhost:8080/jobs/1
```

## üìä Response Examples

### Success Response (GET /jobs)
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Java Developer",
    "description": "Backend development with Spring Boot",
    "minSalary": "70000",
    "maxSalary": "90000",
    "location": "New York"
  }
]
```

### Error Response (Job Not Found)
